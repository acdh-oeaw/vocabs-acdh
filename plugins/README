Place plugins here each one in it's own folder. The folder name will be used as the plugin name.
Include a file called plugin.json in the root of the plugin's folder e.g. 'Skosmos/plugins/myplugin/plugin.json'.
Below you will see a sample of what the plugin.json file could look like:
{
    "js": ["someJavascript.js"],
    "css": ["sampleStyles.css"],
    "templates": ["template.html"]
}
The plugin.json tells Skosmos where it can find the files needed for your plugin.
Filenames should be strings in a javascript array. The above file tells Skosmos
to look for the plugin's js in 'Skosmos/plugins/myplugin/someJavascript.js'.
